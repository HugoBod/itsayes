‚è∫ üìã COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENT TODO - 8 PHASES

  Perfect! I've created an exhaustive 55-task breakdown. Here
  are the critical details you need to know before development:

  üîç ESSENTIAL CONTEXT FOR DEVELOPMENT

  üìä DATA FLOW ARCHITECTURE

  OnboardingData + Seed ‚Üí RandomizerEngine ‚Üí 3 PhotoConfigs ‚Üí
  DALL-E Generation ‚Üí Individual Photos ‚Üí Element Analysis ‚Üí
  Swapping Logic ‚Üí Composition Service ‚Üí Final Collage

  üéØ KEY DECISIONS NEEDED:

  1. SEEDING STRATEGY:
  - Use user ID + timestamp hash for consistent but unique
  seeds?
  - Allow manual seed override for testing?
  - Store seed in database for "regenerate same" feature?

  2. PROBABILITY IMPLEMENTATION:
  - Use Math.random() with seeded RNG (seedrandom library)?
  - Implement custom PRNG for full determinism?
  - Cache probability results per session?

  3. ELEMENT DETECTION METHOD:
  - Use OpenAI Vision API for content analysis?
  - Simple keyword matching in prompts?
  - Third-party image recognition service?

  4. COMPOSITION LAYOUT:
  - Canvas-based composition (node-canvas)?
  - HTML5 Canvas rendering server-side?
  - Sharp.js image manipulation?

  5. STORAGE STRATEGY:
  - Store individual photos + final collage separately?
  - Keep generation metadata for analytics?
  - Implement cleanup for temporary images?

  üö® CRITICAL TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

  PERFORMANCE TARGETS:

  - Total Generation Time: < 45 seconds (3 photos + composition)

  - Individual Photo: < 15 seconds each
  - Composition: < 5 seconds
  - Memory Usage: < 500MB during generation

  ERROR HANDLING STRATEGY:

  // Fallback Chain
  DALL-E Generation ‚Üí OpenAI-2 Retry ‚Üí Fallback Image Pool ‚Üí
  Cached Default

  API RESPONSE STRUCTURE:

  interface MoodboardResponse {
    success: boolean
    data: {
      final_collage_url: string
      individual_photos: [Photo, Photo, Photo]
      generation_metadata: {
        seed: number
        categories_selected: string[]
        generation_time: number
        swaps_performed: number
        layout_type: string
      }
      user_color_palette: string
    }
    fallback_used?: boolean
    error?: string
  }

  üîß IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR EACH PHASE

  PHASE 1 - Critical Details:

  - Categories must be exported as const for TypeScript
  inference
  - Visibility matrix needs enum validation (Required/Optional
  only)
  - Probability weights sum validation (0-1 range)
  - JSON schema for external configuration files

  PHASE 2 - Critical Details:

  - Deterministic randomization is essential for user
  consistency
  - Category exclusion logic (prevent duplicate photo types)
  - Minimum variance checking (ensure photos are visually
  distinct)
  - Seed overflow handling (very large seed numbers)

  PHASE 3 - Critical Details:

  - Template injection security (prevent prompt injection
  attacks)
  - Color palette parsing from onboarding data (hex codes vs
  names)
  - Location context integration with existing service
  - Prompt length limits (DALL-E has token restrictions)

  PHASE 4 - Critical Details:

  - Parallel execution with Promise.allSettled() (not
  Promise.all)
  - Individual timeouts per photo (don't fail entire batch)
  - Photo validation before saving (minimum resolution, content
  checks)
  - Fallback image mapping to categories

  PHASE 5 - Critical Details:

  - High-resolution output (minimum 1920x1080 final collage)
  - Color palette integration as design element (borders,
  backgrounds)
  - Smart photo positioning (ceremony photos larger than
  details)
  - Typography rendering (embedded fonts, proper kerning)

  PHASE 6 - Critical Details:

  - Image analysis accuracy vs speed tradeoff
  - Swapping iteration limits (max 2 swaps to prevent infinite
  loops)
  - Content detection confidence thresholds
  - Performance impact of image analysis on total generation
  time

  PHASE 7 - Critical Details:

  - Backward compatibility with existing useMoodboard hook
  - API versioning strategy (v1 vs v2 endpoints)
  - Error response consistency with current system
  - Database schema updates for new metadata

  PHASE 8 - Critical Details:

  - Test data consistency (fixed seeds for deterministic
  testing)
  - Performance benchmarking tools and metrics
  - Integration test coverage for all fallback scenarios
  - Load testing for concurrent generation requests

  ‚ö†Ô∏è GOTCHAS & EDGE CASES TO HANDLE

  1. DALL-E Specific Issues:

  - Content policy violations (wedding dress too revealing)
  - Prompt interpretation variations (same prompt ‚â† same image)
  - Rate limiting (429 errors during high usage)
  - Image quality inconsistencies

  2. Category Selection Edge Cases:

  - All 3 photos selecting same element type (all flowers)
  - Onboarding data missing critical fields
  - Location context service failures
  - Invalid color palette formats

  3. Composition Challenges:

  - Photos with different aspect ratios
  - Very dark or light photos affecting collage balance
  - Color palette conflicts with generated images
  - Text overlay positioning on busy backgrounds

  4. Storage & Performance:

  - Concurrent generation requests
  - Disk space management for temporary files
  - CDN propagation delays
  - Database connection pooling under load

  üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA FOR EACH PHASE

  Phase 1: All 10 categories + 34 element options properly
  configured
  Phase 2: Deterministic randomization with 0% duplicate results
   for same seed
  Phase 3: 100% template merge success rate with proper field
  injectionPhase 4: 3 distinct photos generated in < 30 seconds
  (90% success rate)
  Phase 5: High-resolution collages with integrated color
  palettes
  Phase 6: < 20% photo swapping rate (most photos are distinct
  enough)
  Phase 7: Full backward compatibility + new features working
  Phase 8: 95%+ test coverage and < 1% error rate in production

  Ready to start with Phase 1.1a (TypeScript interfaces)? The
  foundation needs to be rock-solid for everything else to work
  properly.
